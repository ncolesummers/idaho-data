# Idaho Data API Project Setup Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. GitHub Project Configuration
- ✅ Configured GitHub Project #3 with kanban columns (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, Done)
- ✅ Added custom Sprint field for organizing issues by sprint
- ✅ Project already has Priority (P0, P1, P2) and Size (XS, S, M, L, XL) fields

### 2. GitHub Templates
Created comprehensive issue and PR templates:
- ✅ **Issue Templates:**
  - User Story template (with acceptance criteria, priority, size, sprint)
  - Task template (with task type, checklist, time estimates)
  - Epic template (with goals, success metrics, dependencies)
  - Bug Report template (with severity, steps to reproduce)
  - Documentation template (following Diataxis framework)
- ✅ **Pull Request Template** with testing checklist, performance impact, and security considerations

### 3. GitHub Labels
Created a comprehensive labeling system:
- **Type Labels:** epic, story, task, bug, documentation
- **Sprint Labels:** sprint-0 through sprint-6
- **Priority Labels:** P0 (critical), P1 (high), P2 (medium)
- **Size Labels:** XS, S, M, L, XL
- **Component Labels:** api, infrastructure, testing
- **Status Labels:** blocked, needs-review, ready-to-merge, good first issue, triage

### 4. Sprint 0 Issues Created
**Epics:**
- #1: [EPIC] Repository Setup and Configuration
- #2: [EPIC] Documentation Foundation (Diataxis Framework)

**Stories:**
- #3: [STORY] Initialize Go Module and Project Structure
- #4: [STORY] Set Up GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
- #5: [STORY] Configure Development Tools and Linting
- #6: [STORY] Create README and Initial Documentation
- #7: [STORY] Set Up Documentation Structure (Diataxis)
- #8: [STORY] Development Environment Setup
- #9: [STORY] Create Development Container Configuration

**Tasks:**
- #10: [TASK] Create Go module and basic directory structure

### 5. Sprint 1 Issues Created
- #11: [STORY] Health Check Endpoint
- #12: [STORY] Salary Query Endpoint with Mock Data

## Project Organization

### Kanban Board Workflow
1. **Backlog** - All new issues start here
2. **Ready** - Issues that meet Definition of Ready
3. **In Progress** - Active work (WIP limit: 3)
4. **In Review** - Code review/testing phase
5. **Done** - Completed and merged

### Sprint Planning
- **Sprint 0** - Project Setup (10 issues created)
- **Sprint 1** - Foundation with basic API (2 issues created, more to add)
- **Sprint 2-6** - To be created from original backlog

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Create remaining Sprint 1 tasks for issues #11 and #12
2. Create Sprint 2-6 issues from the original backlog
3. Set sprint and status fields for all issues in the project board
4. Create initial project documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING)

### For Each Sprint
1. Create detailed tasks breaking down each story
2. Follow TDD approach: Red (tests) → Green (implementation) → Refactor
3. Update documentation as features are built
4. Maintain > 80% test coverage

## TDD Workflow Reminder
1. **Red Phase**: Write failing tests first
2. **Green Phase**: Write minimum code to pass tests
3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

## Documentation Strategy (Diataxis)
- **Tutorials** (learning-oriented): Getting started guides
- **How-to Guides** (task-oriented): Specific task instructions
- **Reference** (information-oriented): API docs, configuration
- **Explanation** (understanding-oriented): Architecture, design decisions

## Success Metrics
- Test coverage > 80%
- All PRs pass automated checks
- Documentation complete for each feature
- Clean, idiomatic Go code
- API response times < 200ms for cached queries
